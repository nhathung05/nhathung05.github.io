I have kodi installed in an Nvidia Shield Tube.
I'm trying to modify the Main menu items in the estuary skin by modifying the file "\XML\home.xml" as instructed on Renaming and Reordering Main Menu Items

According to the link Structure of Estuary the files for this skin can be found in C:\Program Files (x86)\Kodi\addons\skin.estuary\xml

But my environment is not windows.
Do any of you know where the estuary skin files are located in an Android TV installation?
